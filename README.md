# firstWebsite
I am currently following the oding project for becoming a full stack dev, this is the first website I am making. I want to make a cinema blog website for my gf because she loves movies and I love her :D.

I am going to be applying everything I see in the course to the website to learn and practice.

I started the index.html in my computer on 08 Sep 2022 20∶25∶56 (which is the first iteration I will upload) but I made the repo on 13 Sep 2022
